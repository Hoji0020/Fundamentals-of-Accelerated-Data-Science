# Fundamentals-of-Accelerated-Data-Science
NVIDIA COURSE  
Apparently, it was a little difficult to pass the assesment when I was going through the course, please attempt the assessment before using the solution provided.   
This is so that you could also learn in the process, rather than just become a copy and paste programmer.   
Depending on the instructor, you might or might not get the solution.   
Also, note that they might update the assessment questions, so there might be slight changes, please double check what you are copying.   
Finally, good luck in your journey to become a programmer. :D
